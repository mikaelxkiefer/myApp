			  <h1> SPC Foundation in Levesville, France</h1>
			  <p style="text-align:justify;">Shaken and moved by the prevalence of misery, poverty, ignorance and religious torpor of his congregation as a result of the Hundred Years War, Father Louis Chauvet, the parish priest of a little village, Levesville-la- Chenard, made a determined and unmistakably decisive endeavor to uplift the human and spiritual levels of his villagers.
				<br><br>
				Having these services for his people in mind: to educate the young girls and to visit and care for the poor in the neighboring hamlets, in 1695, Father Chauvet asked Marie Ann de Tilly, a young lady of nobility, to help him with his plans. Together with some peasant girls of Beauce, their mission of charity was started; a small and dark room in the church served as their first classroom. Not long after, a restored house was renovated to accommodate the increasing number of girls; the “Daughters of the School” (as the volunteers were called) gratuitously persevered in their life of poverty and hard work. Soon after, this fraternal community was established as a religious order, later to be known as the SISTERS OF ST. PAUL OF CHARTRES.
				<br><br>
				The school founded by Fr. Chauvet is known to be the first school in the diocese of Chartres that answered the mandate of King Louis IV of France that parishes should establish small schools in their areas.</p>

			  <h1> SPC Foundation in the Philippines </h1>
			  <p style="text-align:justify;">As the Congregation grew in number, calls to the following mission lands were answered: Cayenne in France Guiana, Madagascar, Martinique and Guadaloupe. It was in the early 20th century that the Congregation responded to the call of the Far East: Hongkong, in 1848 and Vietnam in 1860. These were followed by missions in Japan, Korea, Thailand and China. The Philippine mission was started after the arrival of some Sisters from Vietnam who landed in Dumaguete on October 29, 1904.
